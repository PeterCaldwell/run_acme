This repo is intended to be the *temporary* resting place for scripts for running the ACME model which Philip Cameron-Smith and Peter Caldwell have been working on. 

The main file here is run_acme.template.csh, but bare-bones run scripts for individual machines called run_simple.<machine>.csh are also included for debugging compile/run problems on individual machines. Other scripts may show up as well for easily testing changes across machines, but they aren't of general interest.

To get a copy of the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:PeterCaldwell/run_acme.git
